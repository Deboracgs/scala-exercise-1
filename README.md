# Fizz Buzz challenge

## Logic Rules

Given a sequence of numbers passed in the console we want to print
- Fizz if number is divisible by 3
- Buzz if number is divisible by 5
- FizzBuzz if number is both divisible by 3 and 5

## Coding Rules

- The start and end of the sequence need to be passed in as console parameters
- The words need to be printed to a file in the local hard drive
- This file shall be put in a folder of our choosing via definition of parameters when the code is run

- Every line of code shall have a comment explaining what is being done
- This project needs to have code coverage
- Tests must be done and code coverage should be above 90%
